# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable in ruby, is one that only exists temporarily- or in other words in an instance. Whereas other variables may remain contant. 

  Researched answer: An instance variable in ruby has a name starting with @ symbol, and its content is restricted to whatever the object itself refers to.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in ruby is the same as a code block in JavaScript. 

  Researched answer: In ruby, a block is the same as a method in JavaScript. 
  



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit returns means that there does not need to be a return statment in the function for it to run. 

  Researched answer: Every block in ruby will return the value of the last line automatically, so it is common to not use the [return] keyword in favor of minimal code. 



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object programming involces object and classes as the foundation of coding. This is different than function programming. 

  Researched answer: Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. it is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable piecies of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprient for our code. An object is a particular instance for that class.  

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class. 



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: atter_accessor is a build in method in ruby that acts as both a getter and a setter when constructing code. 

  Researched answer: attr_accessor is a shortcut method when you need both attr_reader and attr_writer. Since both reading and writing data are common, the idiomatic method attr_accessor is quite useful. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: The world's most advanced open source relational database. It is an object-relational database system. PostgreSQL is used aas the primary data store or data warehouse for many, web, mobile, geospacial, and analytics applications. 
 
2. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is an open-sourced software used to build web applications. Rails is a framework used to create websites using the general-purpose programming language Ruby. Ruby ranks amoungst the top ten programming languages predominantly because of the voguishness of rails. 

3. CRUD: The four basic operations (create, read, update, and delete) of data storage, reguarded collectivily. "we'll create a simple databaser on which we will be performing CRUD operations".

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping(ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible types systems using object-oriented programming languages. 

ORM is Object Relational Mapper. It means you don't have to manually call the database yourself; the ORM handles it for you. Ruby on Rails uses one called ActiveRecord, and it's a really good one. 

5. Active Record: An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.
